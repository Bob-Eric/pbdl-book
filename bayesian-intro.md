Introduction to Posterior Inference
=======================

more complex models -> fit data better , but overfit & dont generalize
-> posterior (distrib) inference

std NNs do MLE for weights
"theoretically justifiable" ie correct thing to do -> "posterior inference"
extremely difficult

useful for uncertainty! esp interesting in phys setting

first example here with airfoils, extension from {doc}`supervised-airfoils`
