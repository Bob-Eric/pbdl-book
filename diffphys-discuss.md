**TODO** discussion of DP only

## Summary

Thus, to summarize ...

✅ Pro: 
- uses physical model and numerical methods for discretization
- efficiency of selected methods carries over to training
- tight coupling of physical models and NNs possible

❌ Con: 
- not compatible with all simulators (need to provide gradients)
- ...
